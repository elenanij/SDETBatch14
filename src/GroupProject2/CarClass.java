 /* Create a Class Car that would have the
    following fields: carPrice and color and method
    calculateSalePrice() which should be returning
    a price of the car.
            Create 2 subclasses: Sedan and Truck. The Truck
    class has a field as weight and has its own
            implementation of calculateSalePrice() method
    in which returned price is calculated as
    following: if weight>2000 then returned price
    car should include 10% discount, otherwise 20%
    discount.
    The Sedan class has field as length and also
            does its own implementation of
            calculateSalePrice(): if length of sedan is >20
    feet then returned car price should include 5%
    discount, otherwise 10% discount.  */
